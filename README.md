Repo for my VG33e Swap, Simplified Wiring Harness, possible RUSEFI 
# VG33E ENGINE SWAP
So I am currently following through with Engine swapping my 1988 300zx with a 2002 Quest VG33E, I have been working on this project for several years am approaching the final stages of installation and the problems of wiring and tuning. I do not have the money to BUY premade anything but I do have alot of time. I progress at a very slow rate due to financial reasons but there is nothing I love more than working on this project.


## Contents
1. **Engine Swap**: 

3. **Wiring Harness**: I have been exploring and transcribing the original wiring harness to my car and have not made any modifications YET. My plan is to simplify the system, remove unnecesarry parts, and document the whole process.

4. **OpenSwap**: Eh probably wont keep this name as there are many other Repos with a similar title
